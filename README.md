## Challenge Submission - Module 1

# Name: Jasmine Jasani

# Course: Bootcamp: UTOR-VIRT-FSF-FT-03-2024-U-LOLC-M-F

# Note: I MADE A FEW MISTAKES

I made a few mistakes in the process of submission. I pushed the .html and .css files without an assets folder. During office hours, Sal advised to push the correct files up. I did this, but came into some conlficts in VS. I then uplaoded the entire Develop folder. This folder however contains previous versions of the challenge that I was working on. As I have learned, this is not best practice, or really practice at all. I did not start a repo on github to track my changes and instead made multiple versions of the .html. 

Should this assignment still be eligible for grading, please refer to the index.home

Key takeaways to implement for next project:
1. Create a better README
2. Start with repo, not end with one
3. Make the changes in one place to avoid conflict
4. Read the documentation on how to maintain clean workspaces both remote and locally
